        <li>Green beans chopped</li>
        <li>Liver boiled and diced</li>
        <li>Green peppers</li>
        <li>Green onion</li>
        <li>Sweet corn</li>
        <li>Peas</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil or magarine</li>
        <li>cubes seasoning</li>
        <li>Clean water</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cabbage sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice, chop, dice all the vegetables before proceeding to start cooking. Boil the liver and dice it.</li>
        <li>Add tablespoons or cooking spoons vegetable oil to the rice base before adding the parboiled rice. It helps separate the grains and prevent soggy fried rice.</li>
        <li>When adding water to the stock to cook the rice, please gauge with your eyes. Instead decant from the seasoned water for later use if necessary. Add the decanted water later gradually than adding too much resulting in soggy rice.</li>
        <li>Season the water base for the rice very well with seasoning cubes, blended scotch bonnet peppers, thyme, curry and salt</li>
        <li>Season the fried vegetables with seasoning cubes. You don't want to bite into bland vegetables while eating. Don't overcook the vegetables, saut√© for like 3 minutes. To have crunchy vegetables with vibrant colour.</li>
        <li>Try stir frying the rice and vegetables in batches to avoid easy spoilage, firm and separated grains and to ensure the vegetables go round.</li>
        <li>Use minimal curry or turmeric and avoid other colours...</li>
    </ol>
